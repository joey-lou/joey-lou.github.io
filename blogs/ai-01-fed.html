<h2 id="where-does-the-fed-get-its-money">Where Does the Fed Get Its Money?</h2>
<p>Where does the Federal Reserve get money to buy trillions in bonds?</p>
<p>The answer: <strong>they create it</strong>.</p>
<p>When the Fed buys a \$1 billion Treasury bond from a bank:
1. Fed adds the bond to its <strong>Assets</strong> (+\$1B)
2. Fed credits the bank's reserve account → <strong>Liabilities</strong> (+\$1B)</p>
<p>No vault of cash required. Just entries in a ledger. The Fed is the monopoly issuer of dollars.</p>
<p>This is what people mean by "printing money" — though no actual printing occurs. The constraint isn't technical; it's confidence. Create too much, and people stop trusting the currency.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-money-family-tree">The Money Family Tree</h2>
<p>Not all money is created equal. There's a hierarchy:</p>
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Type</th>
<th>What It Is</th>
<th>Size</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>M0 (Monetary Base)</strong></td>
<td>Currency + Bank Reserves (Fed liabilities)</td>
<td>~\$6T</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>M1</strong></td>
<td>M0 + Checking deposits</td>
<td>~\$18T</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>M2</strong></td>
<td>M1 + Savings, CDs, Money Markets</td>
<td>~\$21T</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The Fed only directly creates M0. Commercial banks multiply it through lending via fractional reserve banking. Every \$100 in reserves can become \$1,000 in deposits through successive rounds of lending.</p>
<p>When the Fed expands the monetary base, banks amplify that expansion through the credit creation process.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="velocity-the-speed-of-money">Velocity: The Speed of Money</h2>
<p>Here's a puzzle: US GDP is ~\$29 trillion, but M2 is only ~\$21 trillion. How does \$21T support \$29T of economic activity?</p>
<p>The answer is <strong>velocity</strong> — each dollar gets spent multiple times per year. The equation is elegant:</p>
<p>$$M \times V = GDP$$</p>
<p>So velocity ≈ 1.4, meaning each dollar "turns over" about 1.4 times annually.</p>
<p>The problem? This used to be 2.0+ in the 1990s. Velocity has been declining.</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong>
- <strong>Wealth inequality</strong>: Money concentrates with those who save rather than spend
- <strong>Aging demographics</strong>: Older populations tend to save more
- <strong>Financialization</strong>: Money flows into assets rather than the real economy
- <strong>Low rates</strong>: Reduced penalty for holding cash
- <strong>Precautionary savings</strong>: Uncertainty encourages hoarding</p>
<p>This is why the Fed could expand the money supply dramatically after 2008 and 2020 without immediate hyperinflation. Much of the new money sat idle.</p>
<p>The corollary: if velocity rebounds, that dormant money activates at once — potentially triggering inflation.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-fiat-money">A Brief History of Fiat Money</h2>
<p>The Fed's unconstrained money-creation powers are historically unprecedented — and only about 50 years old.</p>
<h3 id="the-gold-standard-era-1879-1971">The Gold Standard Era (1879-1971)</h3>
<p>Under the gold standard, the Fed was constrained:
- Had to maintain ~40% gold backing for currency
- Couldn't just "credit accounts" — needed physical gold
- Gold supply is finite → money supply is limited</p>
<p>This was a feature, not a bug. It prevented governments from debasing currency. Prices barely moved from 1800 to 1900.</p>
<p>But it had a flaw: <strong>limited flexibility during crises</strong>. When the economy needed liquidity, the gold constraint limited the Fed's options.</p>
<h3 id="where-did-the-fed-get-gold">Where Did the Fed Get Gold?</h3>
<ol>
<li><strong>Member banks deposited reserves</strong> when joining the Fed (1913)</li>
<li><strong>WWI gold inflows</strong> — Europe paid for American goods in gold</li>
<li><strong>FDR's gold confiscation (1933)</strong> — the big one</li>
</ol>
<p>Executive Order 6102 made private gold ownership illegal. Citizens surrendered their gold at \$20.67/oz. The government then revalued it to \$35/oz — a 69% devaluation of dollar-denominated savings.</p>
<h3 id="nixons-temporary-suspension-1971">Nixon's "Temporary" Suspension (1971)</h3>
<p>By the 1960s, America was running out of gold. France kept demanding gold for their dollars. Reserves were draining.</p>
<p>On August 15, 1971, Nixon announced a "temporary suspension" of gold convertibility. That suspension is now 54 years old and counting.</p>
<p>The dollar became pure faith: <em>"This is valuable because we say so, and everyone believes it."</em></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-feds-power-over-time">The Fed's Power Over Time</h2>
<p>The Fed hasn't always been the powerful institution it is today. Its authority has fluctuated significantly.</p>
<h3 id="the-benjamin-strong-era-1914-1928-one-mans-fed">The Benjamin Strong Era (1914-1928): One Man's Fed</h3>
<p>The early Fed was decentralized — 12 regional banks with real autonomy. But NY Fed Governor Benjamin Strong dominated through sheer competence and force of personality. He was basically the Fed.</p>
<p>Then he died in October 1928. One year before the crash.</p>
<h3 id="the-leaderless-years-1929-1933-policy-paralysis">The Leaderless Years (1929-1933): Policy Paralysis</h3>
<p>Without Strong, the Fed fragmented. Regional banks disagreed. No one had authority to override.</p>
<p>The Fed <strong>tightened into the Depression</strong>. Yes, really. Money supply collapsed 30%. Banks failed in waves. The result was catastrophic.</p>
<h3 id="fdr-takes-over-1933-1951-fed-becomes-a-puppet">FDR Takes Over (1933-1951): Fed Becomes a Puppet</h3>
<p>Roosevelt didn't just strip the Fed of gold — he stripped it of power. The Treasury ran monetary policy. The Fed became a printing press for war finance, required to keep rates pegged at 2.5% regardless of conditions.</p>
<p>"Independent" Fed was a polite fiction.</p>
<h3 id="the-accord-1951-independence-restored">The Accord (1951): Independence Restored</h3>
<p>After WWII, the Fed finally pushed back. The 1951 Treasury-Fed Accord restored Fed independence to set interest rates. The beginning of the modern era.</p>
<h3 id="volcker-1979-1987-the-fed-asserts-independence">Volcker (1979-1987): The Fed Asserts Independence</h3>
<p>Paul Volcker raised rates to 20% to crush inflation, despite political pressure. Unemployment hit 10%. He faced significant public backlash.</p>
<p>He succeeded. Inflation fell. And the Fed demonstrated it could act independently of political pressures.</p>
<h3 id="the-greenspan-bernanke-powell-era-expanded-authority">The Greenspan-Bernanke-Powell Era: Expanded Authority</h3>
<p>Each crisis expanded Fed authority:
- 1987: Emergency rate cuts
- 2008: QE, MBS purchases, emergency lending facilities
- 2020: Corporate bonds, municipal backstops, broad market support</p>
<p>The balance sheet expanded from \$900B (2007) to \$9T (2022). Each crisis brought new powers that were never fully relinquished.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-great-depression-debate">The Great Depression Debate</h2>
<p>Two major schools of thought on the Fed's role:</p>
<h3 id="team-monetarist-friedman-bernanke">Team Monetarist (Friedman, Bernanke)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Fed caused the Depression by not injecting liquidity"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The crash was survivable. But the Fed tightened, banks failed, money supply collapsed. If they'd acted as lender of last resort, it would've been a bad recession, not a decade of misery.</p>
<p>Bernanke acknowledged this at Friedman's 90th birthday: <em>"You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. We won't do it again."</em></p>
<h3 id="team-austrian-hayek-rothbard">Team Austrian (Hayek, Rothbard)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Fed caused the bubble in the 1920s — the crash was the cure"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strong's Fed kept rates too low in the 1920s, fueling speculation and malinvestment. 1929 was the market correcting distortions. Intervention would just delay the inevitable and make it worse.</p>
<h3 id="whos-right">Who's Right?</h3>
<p><strong>Both, kind of.</strong></p>
<p>The bubble shouldn't have been blown (Austrian critique ✓). But once blown, the Fed's response made it worse (Monetarist critique ✓).</p>
<p>The modern Fed learned only half the lesson:
- 1920s lesson: "Don't blow bubbles" → <strong>IGNORED</strong>
- 1930s lesson: "Don't let credit collapse" → <strong>FOLLOWED AGGRESSIVELY</strong></p>
<p>Result: serial bubble-blowing with aggressive crash response. Each rescue creates expectations. Each bubble gets bigger. The bill keeps growing.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-2000-exception-when-bubbles-pop-cleanly">The 2000 Exception: When Bubbles Pop Cleanly</h2>
<p>The dot-com crash was different. The NASDAQ fell 78%. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 49%. Yet the recession was mild — eight months, with unemployment peaking at 6.3%.</p>
<p>Why did this work when 2008 was catastrophic?</p>
<p><strong>It was an equity bubble, not a credit bubble.</strong></p>
<table class="table table-striped table-bordered">
<thead>
<tr>
<th>2000</th>
<th>2008</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>VCs lost money</td>
<td>Banks became insolvent</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Stocks went to zero</td>
<td>Mortgages went underwater</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>No leverage, no contagion</td>
<td>Debt everywhere, cascading defaults</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>When equity holders lose money, they absorb the loss — painful but contained. When credit defaults, it cascades through the system. Banks fail, credit freezes, and the real economy contracts.</p>
<p>In 2000, investors lost money but didn't default on loans. Banks stayed solvent. The system kept functioning.</p>
<p><strong>The catch</strong>: The Fed's response (rates to 1%, held too long) inflated the housing bubble that caused 2008. Even in "success," the seeds of the next crisis were planted.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-modern-dilemma">The Modern Dilemma</h2>
<p>So here we are. The Fed is more powerful than ever — and more trapped than ever.</p>
<p><strong>The trap:</strong>
- Asset prices depend on low rates
- Corporate debt needs cheap refinancing
- Financial system holds massive bond portfolios
- Markets expect rescue ("Fed Put")</p>
<p>Each bubble gets bigger. Each intervention gets larger. The endgame scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Muddle Through</strong>: Low growth forever, Japan-style stagnation</li>
<li><strong>Inflate Away</strong>: Let inflation run hot, stealth default on debt</li>
<li><strong>Volcker 2.0</strong>: Finally allow pain, deep recession, reset</li>
<li><strong>Loss of Confidence</strong>: Dollar crisis, forced austerity</li>
</ol>
<p>No one knows which path will unfold. The current approach of perpetual intervention may be sustainable, or it may not be.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="the-bottom-line">The Bottom Line</h2>
<ul>
<li>The Fed creates money through accounting entries — it works as long as confidence holds</li>
<li>Money supply = Fed's base $\times$ bank multiplication $\times$ velocity</li>
<li>Gold standard constrained money creation; fiat removed all external limits  </li>
<li>Fed power has fluctuated wildly — it's only been "omnipotent" since ~1971</li>
<li>The Depression debate: both the bubble AND the response were policy errors</li>
<li>2000 shows bubbles CAN pop cleanly — but only equity bubbles, not credit bubbles</li>
<li>Modern bubbles are credit-entangled; clean pops are unlikely</li>
<li>The Fed is trapped: can't let it crash, can't stop inflating</li>
</ul>
<p>In short: fiat money is a system built on confidence, and the Fed's job is to maintain that confidence while navigating an increasingly complex set of constraints.</p></div>
